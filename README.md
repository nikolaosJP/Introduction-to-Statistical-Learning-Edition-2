# Introduction-to-Statistical-Learning-Edition-2

This repository contains solutions for the exercises found within this book (please see https://www.statlearning.com/ for more information).

ISL2 is centered around the introduction of numerous machine learning concepts (e.g., Support Vector Machines / Deep Learning) and is comprised of 13 chapters; each of which comes with its own overarching R-markdown file.

The solutions encompassed within this repository were written in RStudio (see https://www.rstudio.com/) which is an integrated development environment (IDE) for the programming language R.

Lastly, it is important to note that these solutions are not entirely my own, and thus credits should also be given to @Amir Sadoughi (https://github.com/asadoughi) who in 2017 worked on solving the exercises provided in the first edition of the ISL.
